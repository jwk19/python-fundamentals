## Running the Scripts

Once in the folder, you can run any Python file using the following command:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Here is a detailed description of each file:

### 1\. `add_numbers.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input two numbers and returns their sum.
-   **Run**:
    `python3 add_numbers.py`

### 2\. `apply_decorator.py`

-   **Description**: Demonstrates the use of a decorator function that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
-   **Run**:
    `python3 apply_decorator.py`

### 3\. `calculate_factorial.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input a non-negative integer and returns the factorial of the number.
-   **Run**:
    `python3 calculate_factorial.py`

### 4\. `car.py`

-   **Description**: Defines a `Car` class with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`, and a method to display the car's information.
-   **Run**:
    `python3 car.py`

### 5\. `count_vowels.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input a string and returns the count of vowels in the string (ignoring case sensitivity).
-   **Run**:
    `python3 count_vowels.py`

### 6\. `is_even.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input a number and returns whether the number is even.
-   **Run**:

    `python3 is_even.py`

### 7\. `merge_dicts.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input key-value pairs for two dictionaries and merges them. If there are common keys, their values are summed up.
-   **Run**:
    `python3 merge_dicts.py`

### 8\. `reversed_text.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input a string and returns the reversed version of the string.
-   **Run**:

    `python3 reversed_text.py`

### 9\. `sort_by_age.py`

-   **Description**: Prompts the user to input names and ages, and then sorts the list of people by age in ascending order.
-   **Run**:

    `python3 sort_by_age.py`

Notes
-----

-   Each script prompts for necessary inputs and outputs results to the terminal.
-   Make sure you are running these scripts in a Python 3 environment to avoid compatibility issues.
